# dmon-worker

A project template for Rust, helping to structure your projects according to best practices.

## Building

If desired, you can build dmon-worker yourself. You will need a working `Rust` and `Cargo` setup. [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/) is the simplest way to set this up on either Windows, Mac or Linux.

Once the prerequisites have been installed, compilation on your native platform is as simple as running the following in a terminal:

```
cargo build --release
```
